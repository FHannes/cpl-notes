# Comparative Programming Languages Notes

This repository contains my notes for the [KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.be) course of [Comparative Programming Languages [H0S01a]](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0S01AE.htm). As the exam for this course is open-book, these notes will mainly contain exercises, API references and clarifications of subjects handled in the book Essentials of Programming Languages 3rd Edition by Daniel P. Friedman and Mitchell Wand.

Feel free to send in pull requests with corrections if I made a typo or simply got something completely wrong. Given that the course is taught in English, I would prefer that any additions to the notes, as well as commit messages are written in English.
